              <p>Hi there! <span className="hand-wave">ðŸ‘‹</span></p>
              <h1>I'm Ishan Avasthi.</h1>
              <p>Yes the same name as the boy in <strong>Taare Zameen Par (Like Stars on Earth).</strong> I saw that movie in 2008 and I decided to keep my name Ishan. :)</p>
              <p>I'm a 17-year-old developer based in India. I specialize in JavaScript and my main area of interest is Front-End Development. I love developing tools/sites/apps that solve real problems or help make someone's life easier. I like impactful work.</p>
              <h3>Skills</h3>
              <p>My current skill set includes <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>, <strong>SASS</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong> etc. </p>
              <p>However, I believe in tool agnostic skills. Being in an industry that moves at the speed of time, it sometimes doesn't matter what frameworks/tools I'm familiar with. Because tools/frameworks are so fickle these days that they can become obsolete within months! What matters more is how fast can I learn and make myself comfortable with newer technology. I believe I'm a quick learner. I prioritize concepts over techniques.</p>
              <p>Simplicity, though overused (and sometimes misused) as a term, is something I really value. I like to build solutions that are simple yet interactive for the users.</p>
              <p>Besides coding, I'm also very passionate about traveling and reading. I feel like the world is a book that was given to me for exploring when I was born, and I don't wanna die before reading all the pages. I plan to become a nomad someday and explore the endless beauty that this planet homes.</p>
